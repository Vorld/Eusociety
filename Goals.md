Decouple transport from simulation logic

WebSockets become just one possible transport
Support multiple data formats (binary, JSON)

Make rendering pluggable

WebGL is one rendering option
Support for different entity visualizations
Allow entity customization

Easy registration of new entity types
Configuration-driven entity behaviors
Provide clear extension points

Well-defined interfaces for new components
Plugin system for adding functionality
